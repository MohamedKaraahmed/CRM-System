# CRM System

## Welcome to our CRM System project!

To enhance user experience and avoid the tedious task of entering commands, our company has decided to present the functionality of each command with the number that stands before it.

### Example for command and its usage:

**View From Menu:**
1. Add Client

To use the functionality for this command, simply enter the digit in front of it, e.g., for the command "Add Client," enter: `1`

### Main Functionalities:

- **Create:** Add new clients to the system.
- **Update:** Modify existing client information.
- **Search:** Look up clients in the system.
- **Delete:** Remove clients from the system.
- **Show All Active Clients:** Display information about all active clients.

### Data Management:

- The application saves and loads data from the "database.csv" file located in the resources' folder.

### Closing the Application:

- Ensure you close the application properly from the MENU to avoid potential data loss.

**Note:** That concludes our brief introduction, soo, Happy Exploring... ðŸ˜Š
