# CRM System

## Welcome to our CRM System project!

Our CRM System is dedicated to facilitating the work of employees within our company in managing relationships with both current and future customers. This application simplifies the process of working with clients, making it more efficient and user-friendly. The project offers an intuitive command-based interface, allowing users to easily create, update, search, delete, and view all active clients. By associating each command with a numeric identifier, the system enhances user interaction.

### Example for command and its usage:

**View From Menu:**
1. Add Client

To use the functionality for this command, simply enter the digit in front of it, e.g., for the command "Add Client," enter: `1`

### Main Functionalities:

- **Create:** Add new clients to the system.
- **Update:** Modify existing client information.
- **Search:** Look up clients in the system.
- **Delete:** Remove clients from the system.
- **Show All Active Clients:** Display information about all active clients.

### Data Management:

- The application saves and loads data from the "database.csv" file located in the resources' folder.

### Closing the Application:

- Ensure you close the application properly from the MENU to avoid potential data loss.
