# CRM System Project README

**Important Note:** Please familiarize yourself with this file before running the project!

## Welcome to our CRM System project!

To enhance user experience and avoid the tedious task of entering commands, our company has decided to present the functionality of each command with the number that stands before it.

### Example for command and its usage:

**View From Menu:**
1. Add Client

To use the functionality for this command, simply enter the digit in front of it, e.g., for the command "Add Client," enter: `1`

### In Conclusion:

- Our application supports main functions: create, update, search, delete, and show all active clients.
- The application is initialized with data from the "database.csv" file located in the resources' folder.
- Ensure you close the application properly from the MENU to avoid potential data loss.

**Note:** That concludes our brief introduction, soo, Happy Exploring... ðŸ˜Š
