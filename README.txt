#Please be a familiar with this file, before running the project!
 
##Welcome to our CRM System project!

-To achieve better user experience and to avoid the boring writing of commands,
our company decided to present the functionality of each command with the number that stands before it.


EXAMPLE for command and their usage:

View From Menu:
	1.Add Client

- To use the functionality for this command, you just need to enter the digit in front of it, so just enter: 1


---In Conclusion: 

-For now, our applications supports the main functions for: create, update, search, delete and show all active clients.

-Our applications is initialized with the data in the "database.csv" file, which is located in the resources' folder.

-Make sure you close the application properly from the MENU, otherwise you may lose information!	

That concludes our brief introduction, soo, Happy Exploring... :)
